This the following how it works : The NFT will serve as proof of ownership and entitle the holder to participate in the DAO, providing increased security and transparency for all parties. Smart-Hive utilizes the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology to secure the DAO and the NFT ownership This approach will enable housing societies to make decisions more efficiently, improve community engagement, and empower residents to have a say in the decisions that affect them.Smart-Hive will allow every resident to propose and vote on decisions using their NFT. Proposals will be submitted to the DAO, with a minimum number of votes required for the proposal to be passed. Voting will be open to all property NFT holders, with each NFT entitling the holder to one vote.Smart contracts will ensure transparency and fairness in the decision-making process, with decisions automatically executed based on the outcome of the voting process..To participate in the DAO, residents will need to purchase an NFT from the property marketplace. This NFT will grant them access to vote and submit proposals on decisions affecting their housing society. As a part of the society maintenance fund, a fixed amount will be deducted from residents wallets each month. This will be automated and decentralized, ensuring that the fund is managed transparently and securely. All funds collected will be stored in a smart contract deployed on the blockchain. This ensures complete transparency and accountability in the management of the funds, as well as protection against potential fraud or misuse. Keep your answers to a max of 5 sentences';
